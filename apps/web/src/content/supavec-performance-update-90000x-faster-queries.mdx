We recently made a significant database optimization to Supavec that has dramatically improved query performance. What started as an investigation into slow API responses ended with a solution that made our document retrieval **90,985 times faster**. I wanted to share how we identified and solved this challenge.

## Identifying the Problem

As more users joined Supavec and started uploading documents, we noticed our API response times gradually degrading. After digging into the issue, we discovered that our approach to querying the `documents` table was creating a major bottleneck.

The culprit? We were filtering documents using this pattern:

```sql
metadata(jsonb)->>file_id = "5696ded6-63da-4bea-a791-17ccf6cb8ea6"
```

While this worked fine with a small dataset, it was forcing PostgreSQL to perform full sequential scans across our growing documents table. With thousands of documents in the system, queries were taking over 10 seconds to complete in some cases.

## Our Solution

We implemented a two-part solution to address this performance issue:

### 1. Schema Improvement

First, we added a dedicated `file_id` column to the documents table instead of storing this identifier in a JSON metadata field. This allowed us to use a much simpler and more efficient query:

```sql
WHERE file_id = "5696ded6-63da-4bea-a791-17ccf6cb8ea6"
```

This required moving away from the opinionated `SupabaseVectorStore.from_documents` approach from Langchain, which limited our ability to customize our data storage. By implementing our own solution, we gained more control over how document data is stored and retrieved.

### 2. Strategic Indexing

The schema change provided a good improvement, but we took it a step further by adding a partial index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_file_id ON public.documents USING btree (file_id) WHERE (deleted_at IS NULL)
```

This partial index focuses specifically on our most common query pattern: retrieving active (non-deleted) documents for a specific file ID.

## The Results

The performance improvement exceeded our expectations:

**Before optimization:**
- Execution time: **10,008.379 ms** (over 10 seconds)
- Full sequential scan required
- 186,576 rows unnecessarily examined to find just 14 matching documents

**After optimization:**
- Execution time: **0.110 ms** (just over a tenth of a millisecond)
- Efficient index scan
- Direct lookup with minimal overhead

This represents a **90,985x speed improvement** in document retrieval operations!

## What This Means For Supavec Users

If you're using Supavec, you'll notice several immediate benefits:

- Significantly faster API response times
- Better handling of concurrent requests
- Improved scalability as your document collection grows

This is particularly valuable for users who have uploaded many documents or who run complex queries across multiple documents.

## Technical Deep Dive

For those interested in the database internals, here's a comparison of the query execution plans:

### Before Optimization
```
Seq Scan on documents
(cost=0.00..75636.85 rows=923 width=1441) (actual time=1116.145..10008.227 rows=14 loops=1)
  Filter: ((deleted_at IS NULL) AND ((metadata ->> 'file_id'::text) = '01200bed-1784-47dd-847c-9799d3a2978f'::text))
  Rows Removed by Filter: 186576
Planning Time: 0.803 ms
Execution Time: 10008.379 ms
```

The key issue here is the "Seq Scan" - PostgreSQL had to examine every row in the table.

### After Optimization
```
Index Scan using idx_documents_file_id on documents
(cost=0.29..52.79 rows=46 width=1441) (actual time=0.020..0.032 rows=14 loops=1)
  Index Cond: (file_id = '01200bed-1784-47dd-847c-9799d3a2978f'::uuid)
Planning Time: 0.684 ms
Execution Time: 0.110 ms
```

Now we're seeing an "Index Scan" - PostgreSQL can jump directly to the relevant rows.

## Looking Forward

This optimization is part of our ongoing commitment to building a fast, reliable, and scalable open-source RAG platform. We're continuing to monitor system performance and work on additional improvements, including:

- Enhanced vector search algorithms
- Optimized document chunking strategies
- More efficient embedding generation
- Advanced caching mechanisms

Thanks to everyone who's been using Supavec and providing valuable feedback. As an open-source project, we're committed to transparency about our development process and excited to share these improvements with the community.
